    <p>The source of my motivation in programming and coding began with designing 
        art and ideas for friends and the company that I work for. 
        For me, the biggest passion is to create something visual 
        with interaction and utility, that is where programming comes in. 
        The awesome combination that makes your idea truly alive!

        <ol>Html Skills
            <li>Learn the importance and usage of Html.</li>
            <p>The first glance about html may be scaring or confusing, I spent years trying to get the idea and 
                start to enjoy programming. In my opnion is very important try different languages in an easy manner until you find yourself comfortable before going deeper on something.
            </p>
            <li>Understand the principles of the language.</li>
            <p>As mentioned before, we need to like coding a especific language, that's because it is big part of the tool, sometimes
                you may what that tool does but you don't feel comfortable to use or even to learn now.
                When I started to learn I thought that starting with Java would be a nice thing kkkkk, of course not, we need to start somehting that we will get it
                and ejoy it!
                 As for Html we understand easily the objective and soon enough we meet the importance of Css, Js, etc. And we end up learning all together, keeping the challenge fresh and improving everyday.

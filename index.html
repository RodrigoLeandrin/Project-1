    <p>The source of my motivation in programming and coding began with designing 
        art and ideas for friends and the company that I work for. 
        For me, the biggest passion is to create something visual 
        with interaction and utility, that is where programming comes in. 
        The awesome combination that makes your idea truly alive!

        <ol>Html Skills
            <li>Learn the importance and usage of Html.</li>
            <p>The first glance about html may be scaring or confusing, I spent years trying to get the idea and 
                start to enjoy programming. In my opnion is very important try different languages in an easy manner until you find yourself comfortable before going deeper on something.
            </p>
            <li>Understand the principles of the language.</li>
            <p>As mentioned before, we need to like coding a especific language, that's because it is big part of the tool, sometimes
                you may what that tool does but you don't feel comfortable to use or even to learn now.
                When I started to learn I thought that starting with Java would be a nice thing kkkkk, of course not, we need to start somehting that we will get it
                and ejoy it!
                 As for Html we understand easily the objective and soon enough we meet the importance of Css, Js, etc. And we end up learning all together, keeping the challenge fresh and improving everyday. 
            </p>
            <li>The first tags, the door to Imagination</li>
                <p>Organizing ideas with Design has always been a strong passion to me, especially that
                    when we can mix Design with Coding, before I started learning Html I had the point of view of Adobe Illustrator and 
                    Afinity, there creating text boxes and shapes with especific position is very easy.
                    Now with Html and Css things get harder but the potential is amazing! This process is little 
                    bit harder but certainly worth it!

                </p>

                <li>Harder, but more Powerful</li>

                <p>My first real created site for a company was built on Wix, this project is used for my 
                    family company until the present day. At the time Wix was on its start, I was 16 years old and I thought that
                    these Website creators would really substitute all the previous languages, I was very young and I was sure 
                    that technology would swalllow every previous tool, like a new video game, social media or a graphic card.
                    After 10 years I realized that I am wrong. I have crazy concept about this. Sure there are 
                    many easy and cheap tools to create Websites and this things alike, but even so people still
                    prefer to aquire services.
                        Also, after learning for some time, I noticed that even the simplest Website is 
                        demanding complex structure and always will be possible with the "parent languages" as Html, Css and JavaScript.

                </p>
                
                <li>The more you learn, the more you want</li>
                <p>Today is November 5th, 2023. Now I can really can say I feel the necessity and power of usage
                    of Java Script, at the start I could see Html and Css as enough tools to create a simple website, now
                    I really want to improve my skills in JavaScript to create amazing Design with great Power. I know how hard can 
                    be at the beginning, trust me, I felt same way and I still do ! kkkk. If you like just a litte a bit, I am sure 
                    that after you learn more you will enjoy much more and will be much smarter and faster.  

                </p>

                <li>Time to check the roots again</li>
                <p>Today is November 20th, 2023. Still improving my skills in Java Script, seems much easier now, but I feel 
                    the necessity to come back and learn Html and CSS fundamentals and adavanced skills. This way I can use them
                    on future projects.
                </p>
                <li>The end of this project</li>
                <p>The purpose of this first was to improve and train my skills with Html and Css, changing colors, background, playing
                    with flex box, creating list, margins... Now I close this project to keep up with new ones, I will always come back 
                    to see my first words of code here.
                </p>
